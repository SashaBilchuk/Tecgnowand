1. https://github.com/petewarden/magic_wand
2. https://github.com/ranitraj/SmartThermostat

## Intro
The assignment was to use IMU sensor of arduino + bluetooth + android app.
I thought it would be cool to movement of a hand/wand into a symbol which could be translated into a magic spell for a DnD game for example.
Hyped on Cyberpunk 2077 game I liked the idea of technology becoming magic back again.
Therefore I came with a name - Technowand!
